### AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

| 6/2018
| This course focused on neural networks and the foundations of AI: the
  programming tools (Python, NumPy, PyTorch), the math (calculus and
  linear algebra), and the key techniques of neural networks (gradient
  descent and backpropagation).

Projects:

1.  [Dog Image
    Identification](https://github.com/aimeeu/Udacity-AIProgrammingWithPython/tree/master/dog-image-classification-exercise)
2.  [Flower
    Classification](https://github.com/aimeeu/Udacity-AIProgrammingWithPython/tree/master/final-project-flower-classification)

After completing this nanodegree, I realized that while I find AI
fascinating, coding a neural network is not an area I want to pursue.
