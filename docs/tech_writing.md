Technical Writing
=================

I\'ve been writing in one area or another since I was a child - silly
poems, short stories in grade school, exceedingly bad poetry, and
college research papers. My technical writing started a few years after
I became a software developer. After my colleagues found out I had
taught English as a Second Language, no matter what project I worked on
I was asked to proofread UI text, write Help content, work on business
requirements, and create design documentation in addition to designing,
coding, and testing software.

The Reasons, or Why I Like Tech Writing
---------------------------------------

Good documentation is key to an Open Source project\'s widespread
adoption by both end-users and developers, yet creating documentation
seems to be the last thing on the list, almost an afterthought in many
cases. As an end-user, I\'ve been frustrated more than once by
incomplete installation and user guides with higgledy-piggledy content.
Lack of details, screenshots, and step-by-step organization are areas I
am good at addressing. As a developer, I\'ve been equally frustrated by
the lack of comprehensive API documentation. Both of these drove me to
focus more on tech writing than on developing software in recent years.

-   I like to organize chaos
-   I like to bring clarity to muddy waters
-   I like to enable developers to be better documentors, whether it\'s
    providing them with page templates or enabling the creation of
    automated API documentation from a Swagger JSON file
-   I like figuring out how stuff works and creating guides to help the
    next user or developer

I\'ve created documentation in HTML, reStructuredText, and Markdown for
Open Source projects, internal company projects, and my personal
projects on GitHub.

My Contributions
----------------

### Publicly Available Docs

#### Acumos

| **Markup**: reStructuredText
| **Tools**: Sphinx, Pandoc
| [Acumos Docs](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/) \| [Acumos
  GitHub](https://github.com/acumos/documentation) \| [Acumos
  Wiki](https://wiki.acumos.org)

My involvement with Acumos documentation started with a phone call from
JM, my AVP, asking me to take a look at the Acumos project\'s docs and
tell him what was missing. This was two weeks prior to the project\'s
launch as an Open Source project in the Linux Foundation. An automated
documentation project had been created using Sphinx, with submodules
linking to most of the component repositories. However, developers
hadn\'t been given guidelines on creating documentation: file structure,
naming, content, reStructuredText. In addition, most of the end-user
documentation was non-existent, and nobody had even started pulling all
the docs together into a coherent, user-friendly format. So I hatched a
plan:

-   Analyze all the docs in the component repos
-   Create detailed Jira tickets for shortcomings
-   Work with developers to resolve issues, many of which resulted from
    content being created with Word and converted to rST using Pandoc
-   Brush up on Sphinx
-   Move all end-user docs to the Docs project so I would have merge
    control
-   Create and/or edit the end-user docs, add screen shots, clarify
    instructions
-   Create and organize the main docs site (docs.acumos.org) as well as
    tweak the theme for Acumos colors

I had the part-time help of one person reviewing the component docs, but
the rest was up to me. I put in two 70-hr weeks getting the automated
documentation and the wiki ready for the project\'s public launch at the
Open Networking Summit in 2018.

I took up the role of Docs PTL for the first release of Acumos in
December, 2018.

My duties included:

-   [Docs](https://wiki.acumos.org/display/DOCS) PTL: created, edited,
    and curated automated documentation
    ([RTD](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/),
    [GitHub](https://github.com/acumos/documentation/tree/athena)) for
    the first release
-   Wiki Wiz: a few pages had been created with content ported from an
    internal wiki, but I ran with it \-- structured the rest of the
    [wiki](https://wiki.acumos.org/) using Spaces; created
    community-centered content; worked with Linux Foundation support
    staff to install and configure needed plugins, such as draw.io;
    ongoing content creation and curation while I was Docs PTL
-   Technical Charter: created the project\'s [Technical
    Charter](https://wiki.acumos.org/display/TSC/Technical+Community+Document);
    only approved sections were published on the wiki

Examples from the Acumos wiki:

-   [Communication](https://wiki.acumos.org/display/AC/Communication)
-   [Your First
    Patch](https://wiki.acumos.org/display/AC/Your+First+Patch)
-   [Tool Guides](https://wiki.acumos.org/display/AC/Tool+Guides)

Examples from the Acumos Documentation:

-   [Home page](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/)
-   [Athena Maintenance Release
    Notes](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/release-notes/athena-maint/index.html)
-   [Portal and Marketplace User
    Guide](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/AcumosUser/portal-user/index.html)
-   [Portal and Marketplace Publisher
    Guide](https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/AcumosUser/portal-publisher/index.html)

A change in employment circumstances led to my resignation as Docs PTL.
Before I left, I moved the end-user docs to their respective component
repositories so Acumos could function without a Docs PTL.

Items I wish I had been able to work on before I left:

-   API code is documented using Swagger tags; the Docs project includes
    the sphinx-swaggerdoc plugin; figure out how to get developers to
    actually generate the Swagger JSON file for inclusion in automated
    documentation
    ([example](https://docs.acumos.org/en/latest/docs-contributor-guide/templates/api-docs.html))
-   [reno](https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/) for release notes
-   Explore the many Sphinx plugins to get an idea of what could be used
    on the project
-   Convert the Docs project to use Intersphinx linking and eliminate
    submodules

#### OPNFV

**Markup**: reStructuredText

I was assigned to work on OPNFV at the same time I was working on
OpenStack Congress (2016-2017). I contributed how-to pages and updates
to the Copper, JOID, Models, VES, Developer and Infrastructure spaces as
well as updating existing project docs written in rST. An example from
the wiki:

-   [DevStack in a VM
    Notes](https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/copper/DevStack+in+a+VM+Notes)

#### OpenStack Projects

**Markup**: reStructuredText, Python docstring

##### Murano

I [modified docstring comments](https://review.opendev.org/#/c/307384/6)
to be PEP8 compliant, as well as enhanced the comment content as needed.

##### Congress

-   Minor patches, such as fixing rST compile warnings
-   [Enhanced congress-pythonclient installation guide to add installing
    from a branch](https://review.opendev.org/#/c/424738/1)
-   [Add HA Overview guide](https://review.opendev.org/#/c/350731/)
    (written based on HA blueprint)

I also acted as the Cross-Project Docs Liaison.

#### Personal Project Documentation

**Markup**: reStructuredText, Markdown

#### K-9 Obedience Training Club of Menomonee Falls

I\'ve been the content creator and webmaster for my local dog training
club since 2001. The [site](https://k9otc.com/) has undergone many
changes, the latest of which was a move to GoDaddy and subsequent
redesign using GoDaddy\'s site builder.

#### Ken - A Life in Pictures

Since I was creating photo collages for the funeral, I threw together
this memorial [website](https://cardiganpeke.godaddysites.com/) for
out-of-state relatives who were unable to attend the service.

#### Etherpads

Quite a bit of my job at AT&T Labs involved figuring out how Open Source
products worked and informally documenting my findings for my
supervisor. I used etherpads extensively to take notes, record
step-by-step procedures, and the dreaded \"it\'s not working the way
it\'s supposed to be working\" situations. The etherpads are on public
servers and still accessible.

Sampling of Topics:

-   Cheatsheet for contributing patches to OpenStack, OPNFV, and Acumos
-   Installation notes for various projects
-   Conference notes

### Not Publicly Available Docs

Much of the technical writing I\'ve done is not publicly available -
internal requirements, architecture and design, help system content.

From 2017-2019 I really enjoyed assignments from my AVP. It always
started with a phone call\.... JM didn\'t have time to look into
something, so he asked me to do the research and write up my findings. I
did Proofs of Concept, gap analysis, and pure \"what is this and how
does it work\" research.

-   Researched the Moby project, its relation to Docker Enterprise, and
    whether it was cost effective to build or buy an Edge Cloud/IoT
    solution
-   Cloud Native POCs comparing Apcera, RedHat OpenShift, and Docker
    Enterprise Edition, which included ability to run across both AMD
    and ARM hardware
-   Researched how to deploy IoT-like hardware and images to an Edge
    Cloud and then push OSs to the hardware; this included setting up
    and configuring Raspberry PI boards into a Docker Swarm cluster,
    determining whether we could push a custom OS that I built with
    LinuxKit to the machines

### Spinx Themes

These days, all themes should be mobile-friendly. I admit I am partial
to themes with an expandable left menu section. For sites without
several heading levels in one or more pages, I like the Spinx Bootstrap
Theme.

Geeky Pet Peeves
----------------

Too many years of teaching English composition to non-native
speakers\...

-   Using possessive instead of plural:

    > -   *Lets discuss how to document REST API's*
    > -   *I was born in the 1960\'s*

-   Using the subject instead of the object form after a preposition

    > -   *for you and I*
    > -   *between you and I*

-   Numerous capitalization and punctuation errors in Open Source
    documentation (I\'m happy to help address those!)
